Know what  grow up  you nasty  I don’t understand why they trippin’  if you ask me Flow is just the nicest  I emit the propane I just spit  probably just raised the gas prices Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me What you want  dawg Tryna stay recession free And spit  refreshingly when I rock the stadium You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee Now I’m standing next to
